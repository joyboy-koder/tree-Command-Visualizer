# 🌳 Tree Command Visualizer (Linux Learning Project)

This project simulates the Linux `tree` command using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

In Linux, when you run:

$ tree


You see the folder structure displayed in a tree format.

This project recreates that experience inside a web browser.  
It prints a simple directory tree using text characters like:

myProject
├── index.html
├── css
│ └── style.css
└── js
└── app.js

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

I am learning Linux, and I want each command I learn to have a small project on GitHub.  
This project is for the **tree** command.

The goals are:

- Understand how the `tree` command displays folders  
- Practice representing directory structures using text  
- Build a simple web version of a Linux terminal output  
- Add it to my GitHub Linux learning journey

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** → for displaying the output  
- **CSS** → for styling with a terminal-like look  
- **JavaScript** → for loading the tree text  

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The folder structure is stored as text inside the JavaScript file  
2. When the page loads, the structure is printed inside a `<pre>` tag  
3. The text formatting makes it look just like the real Linux output

## 🔗 Part of My Linux Journey

This project is part of my **Linux Learning Series**, where I recreate Linux commands using web technologies to better understand how they work.

More Linux command projects coming soon!
